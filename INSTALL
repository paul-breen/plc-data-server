Build instructions for the PLC Data Server (PDS)

In this directory run './configure' with the necessary command line options
(type './configure --help' for a list of options).

Then type 'make'.  This will build the libraries, the PDS, utilities etc.

Lastly type 'make install' to install the software to the configured location.

An example PLC configuration file has been provided to base your own
configuration on.  This is located in the data directory under the configured
install directory.
