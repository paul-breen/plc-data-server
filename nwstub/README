The PDS network stub provides a TCP/IP server interface to the PDS.

The network stub connects via the PDS API to a local PDS as a client.  It then
presents a network server interface via a listening socket on its well-known
port (9574), and accepts network client connections via the PDS Network
Protocol (PDSNP) API.  In this way, it network-enables the PDS by acting as a
proxy server.  By default, it will run as a daemon process, with no
controlling terminal.

As a secure default, the network stub listens on localhost.  However, if a
client is local, then the network stub is pretty much redundant, so normally
the network stub should be invoked with the hostname or IP address of the
host.  To instruct the network stub to listen on all network interfaces
(including localhost), then an IP address of 0.0.0.0 should be specified.

Examples
--------

Run the network stub with defaults.  This listens on localhost:9574 and runs as a daemon process in the background:

./pds_nwstubd

Run the network stub with defaults, but in debug mode.  This stops the network
stub from daemonising, and prints debug messages to the calling terminal:

./pds_nwstubd -d

Instruct the network stub to listen on a given host and port, and with an
increased debug level:

./pds_nwstubd -h 192.168.0.1 -p 9999 -d 2

Instruct the network stub to listen on all network interfaces, on its standard
port, and to run in the background as a daemon:

./pds_nwstubd -h 0.0.0.0
