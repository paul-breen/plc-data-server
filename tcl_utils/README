TK Utility
==========

This program, chkcnf, is used to read a plc.cnf file and then analyze the
contents to make sure they fit within the rules of the data server.  It
highlights duplicated tagnames, errors in ordering and ranging data blocks etc.

The program can also connect to the PLC Data Server and as such look at the
current values within tags.
