<H2>Outline</H2>
<P>This library provides client programs with a C programming language Application Programming Interface (API) to the <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#pds">PLC Data Server</A> (PDS).  The API uses a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#tag">tag abstraction</A>.</P>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>connect_to_server()<BR>
This function allows a client program to connect to the PDS.<BR>
A server connection key is passed to the function.  If the
connection key is NULL or zero, then a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#pds_ipckey">default</A> is used.
The client program is connected to the server which is
identified by the connection key.  The server connection
structure is returned which is used in all subsequent
calls to the server.  On error a null pointer is returned.

<P>disconnect_from_server()<BR>
This function allows a client program to disconnect from the PDS (unregister from the <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#pds_ipc_resources">PDS's IPC resources</A> and free memory for the connection structure).<BR>
A valid server connection struct is passed to the function.
The client program is disconnected from the server.  If an
error occurrs a -1 is returned.

<P>get_tag()<BR>
This function allows a client program to get a tag's value.<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname and a string for
storage of the tag's value are passed to the function.
The tagname is accessed in the shared memory segment and
its corresponding value is returned.  A flag is returned to
indicate whether the tag was found or not.

<P>get_tagf()<BR>
This function allows a client program to get a tag's value (formatted).<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname, a string for
storage of the tag's value and a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#fmtspec">data format specifier</A>
are passed to the function.
The tagname is accessed in the shared memory segment and
its corresponding value is returned formatted as the
specified type.  A flag is returned to indicate whether the
tag was found or not.

<P>get_strtag()<BR>
This function allows a client program to get a contiguous string of tags' values as a single value (formatted).<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname (base), the number
of tagvalues to read, a string for storage of the tags'
value and a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#fmtspec">data format specifier</A> are passed to the
function.
The tagnames are accessed in the shared memory segment and
their value's as a string are returned formatted as the
specified type.  A flag is returned to indicate whether the
tag was found or not.

<P>set_tag()<BR>
This function allows a client program to set a tag's value.<BR>
A valid server connection, the base tagname, the no. of
tags to write and the tag value(s) as an integer pointer
are passed to the function.
A message is sent to the PLC server requesting that the
tag value(s) be written to the PLC.  A flag is returned to
indicate whether the message was sent to the server or not.

<P>set_strtag()<BR>
This function allows a client program to set a contiguous string of tags' values as a single value.<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname (base) and the tags'
value represented as a string are passed to the function.
A message is sent to the PLC server requesting that the
tagvalue be written to the PLC.  A flag is returned to
indicate whether the message was sent to the server or not.

<P>get_flag_state()<BR>
This function allows a client program to get a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#flag">flag's</A> state.<BR>
A valid server connection and the tagname of the flag to
get are passed to the function.
The flag's value is returned.  On error a -1 is returned.

<P>set_flag_state()<BR>
This function allows a client program to set a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#flag">flag's</A> state.<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname of the flag to set
and the value to set are passed to the function.
A flag is returned indicating if the flag was set.

<P>get_taglist()<BR>
This function allows a client program to get a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#taglist">taglist's</A> values.<BR>
A valid server connection and a PLC taglist structure
containing an array of tag structs to get data for are
passed to the function.
The tags' data are read into the value strings of the
tag structs.  A count is returned of number of tags read
from the PLC.  On error a -1 is returned.

<P>get_wordbit_state()<BR>
This function allows a client program to get a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#wordbit">wordbit's</A> value.<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname and the bit number
within the word (1-16) to get are passed to the function.
The bit's value is returned.  On error a -1 is returned.

<P>set_wordbit_state()<BR>
This function allows a client program to set a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#wordbit">wordbit's</A> value.<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname, the tagvalue, the
bit number within the word (1-16) to set and the bit value
to set the bit to are passed to the function.
A flag is returned indicating if the tag was set.  The tag
value is modified with the bit value.

<P>get_tag_status()<BR>
This function allows a client program to get a tag's PLC status.<BR>
A valid server connection, the tagname and a pointer to the
tag's status are passed to the function.
The tagname is accessed in the shared memory segment and
its corresponding status is set.  On error a -1 is returned.

<P>check_proto_ver()<BR>
This macro function allows a client program to get the <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#febe_proto_ver">front-end/back-end (febe) protocol version</A> that the PDS is using.  If a client connects with a different febe protocol version than that of the PDS, the connection fails.<BR>
A valid server connection is passed to the function.
The febe protocol version is returned.

<P>check_plc_status()<BR>
This macro function allows a client program to check whether the status of the PLC was good after calling an API function.<BR>
A valid server connection is passed to the function.
The status word of the PLC on which the tag passed in the API call resides is returned.  A zero signifies success (no status exists for this tag on this PLC), a positive integer signifies a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#plcstatus">status condition</A> exists for this tag on this PLC.

<P>print_plc_status()<BR>
This macro function allows a client program to print a string detailing the status of the PLC after calling an API function.<BR>
A valid server connection is passed to the function.
The string detailing a <A HREF="pds_glossary.html#plcstatus">PLC's status</A> is returned.
