To use plcmm as a CGI binary in a web application we have provided a (simple)
CGI wrapper script (plcmm_cgi) around plcmm.

This script should be copied along with the PLC memory mapper (plcmm)
to your web server's cgi-bin directory (or wherever you run cgi scripts
from).  It should be owned by the unpriveledged web user - e.g.,
nobody:nogroup

The shell script is very simple and just passes the CGI mode flag to plcmm
to tell it to output HTML tables:

  # Run the PLC Memory Mapper in CGI mode
  ./plcmm -c

However, plcmm is capable of more control over its output than just this
(type plcmm -h for usage) & it may be that you need to edit the wrapper
script to get full control over plcmm's output.

We have also provided a slightly more complicated example of a wrapper for
plcmm that "pushes" refreshed content from your web server to a browser
giving updated values every 5 (default) seconds.  Read the script
(plcmm_cgi_server_push) to understand how this is done.  The script is well
commented.

There is another script (plcmm_plain) that also runs as a CGI script but only
outputs plain text instead of HTML.
